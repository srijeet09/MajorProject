        MISSION
      </h2>
      <div id="para2">
        Our mission is " Providing the Knowledge on the Future of Voting. â€œ Our
        goal is to support the implementation of modern election processes and
        technologies with the view of facilitating elections and increasing
        security and transparency. Voting technologies have the potential to
        improve elections and to increase voter turnout since remote voters and
        voters with disabilities are enabled to vote. We are convinced that
        voting technologies are the future of voting. We support election
        administrations and organizers as well as technology vendors in
        developing and implementing technology and tackling the challenges to
        enable a successful application.
